Through stormy seas and winds so wild,  
We set our course, so fierce, so styled.  
With code as treasure, maps in hand,  
We sail to Git's fair distant land.  

The Captains watch with knowing eyes,  
To test our skill 'fore claiming prize.  
"Add yer loot, commit it tight,  
Push it forth by morning's light!"  

Aboard our ship, we stash our gold,  
In chests of files, both new and old.  
But 'til we send a parrot's call,  
The Captains won't yet see it all.  

So raise the mast, the voyage calls,  
To Git Island, past ocean squalls!  
Through merge and pull, through logs we read,  
To claim our place and take the lead!
